# Codoma
Programmer's text editor for Android
Based on sources of [TextWarrior](https://sourceforge.net/projects/textwarrior/), [Turbo Editor](https://github.com/vmihalachi/turbo-editor) and [ShaderEditor](https://github.com/markusfisch/ShaderEditor).


This editor is designed as a free, no ads, no pay-functional program. Other editors are paid on Android, with advertising, outdated, without the extensive functionality, with poor design. They are difficult to develop, and it is practically impossible to expand their capabilities.
